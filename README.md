#### `consumption_saving.ipynb`

Implements a basic T-period consumption-saving model using backward induction and simulation. Includes visualizations of policy and value functions, along with counterfactual analysis for different income and wealth scenarios.

#### `ConSavLabor.ipynb`

Implements a dynamic T-period consumption-saving-labor model with endogenous human capital accumulation. Solves the model using backward induction, simulates individual behavior, and includes counterfactual analysis for taxes, wages, preferences, and initial wealth.

#### `ConSavLabor_college.ipynb`

This notebook implements a dynamic programming model of **college and labor supply decisions** over the life cycle. The agent chooses between attending college or entering the labor market at age 18, and then makes optimal consumption, saving, and labor supply decisions based on their human capital accumulation, wages, and preferences.
