    "### Dynamic College and Labor Supply Model\n",

    "This model describes an individual’s lifetime decision between **education** and **working**, accounting for **consumption**, **savings** and **human capital accumulation**.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the initial period \\( t = 0 \\), the agent chooses whether to attend college or enter the labor market, comparing the expected values of each path. If college is chosen, the agent consumes while incurring education costs and increasing human capital. Upon graduation, the agent enters the labor market, deciding how much to **consume** and **work**, with wages depending on accumulated human capital.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If **college** is chosen, the agent remains a student for $ t_{\\text{college}} = 4 $ years, during which they **consume**, **pay tuition**, and **accumulate human capital**. The psychic cost $ \\kappa_X $ is also incurred each year.\n",
    "- After graduation, at time $t + t_{\\text{college}}$, the agent enters the **labor market** with enhanced human capital and starts making labor supply decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If **work** is chosen directly, the agent starts earning immediately and decides each period how much to **consume** and **work**, while human capital grows on-the-job.\n",
