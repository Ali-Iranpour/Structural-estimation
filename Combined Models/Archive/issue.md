## 1. Empirical / Quantitative Problem  
* When the altruism weight $\omega$ rises, the parent channels almost all extra resources into terminal-period education spending $e_{p,T}$, while the cash transfer $tr_T$ rises only slightly—or even falls.  
* Along the asset grid:  
  * $e_{p,T}(a_T)$ is **increasing** in parental assets.  
  * $tr_T(a_T)$ is **decreasing** in parental assets.  
* This patterns contradict empirical evidence: richer parents usually give **larger transfers**. 
* The transfer amount is less than 10K

## 2. Mechanism Behind 
1. **Double dividend to education**  
   * Education lifts the child’s lifetime wage path inside $V^{\text{child}}$ **and** appears directly in the parent’s own utility through the $\tilde{\mu}_T\,\phi_3\log HC_T$ term.  
2. **First-order conditions (FOCs) imply opposite slopes**  
   * As parental assets $a_T$ rise, $\beta V^P_a(a')$ (the MU of own consumption) falls.  
   * Cheapest way to satisfy the **transfer** FOC ⇒ *lower* $tr_T$.  
   * Cheapest way to satisfy the **education** FOC ⇒ *raise* $e_{p,T}$.

## 3. Candidate Fixes  

Should I add Warm-glow utility because it adds marginal utility that depends only on $tr_T$? or anything else?
